# The Bankist

Bankist is a user-friendly web application designed as a banking platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a comprehensive range of features that reflects real-life banking operations, such as money transfers, loan applications, and account closures. The application's user interface provides real-time transaction updates, allowing users to sort their transactions, view their total balance, monitor inflows and outflows (deposits/withdrawals), as well as track the accrued interest. Furthermore, to ensure security and privacy, Bankist includes an automatic logout timer that initiates user logout after 2.5 minutes of user inactivity.<br><br>
